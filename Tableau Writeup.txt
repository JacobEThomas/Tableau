For this data, I was interested in looking at demographic trends in use of the CitiBike 
service. Demographics (age and gender) allow for insights that marketing 
executives can use to make decisions about which groups of people to target 
with advertisements. 


First, I visualized the average trip duration and number of records by gender. 
The data showed that men represent nearly 3.5 times as many transactions, but 
that women rode for longer duration per trip, and thus spent more money per trip. 
This suggests that the customer acquisition efforts should be targeted to women 
because they are underrepresented and spend more per transaction. 


Next, I split the file by people aged >30 or <30 years old, and found that younger 
people (less than 30 years) are grossly underrepresented in the CitiBike customer 
base. Additionally, younger people have similar trip durations to older people. 
Thus, it would be wise for advertisers to target younger people to bring in more 
new customers.


Taken together these two phenomena suggest that advertising dollars are best spent 
by targeting young women. There are more young women that who are not using CitiBike 
than any other demographic that I looked at, so the odds of turning an impression into 
a transaction are highest with this group.


Other trends I generated in the Tableau notebook include the 10 most popular station IDâ€™s, 
as well as a city map displaying all transactions on a bubble chart. The bubble chart 
displays location by number of transactions and duration of ride.  Advertising executives 
would be keen to advertise in areas with both high ride duration (more money per transaction) 
and low number of transactions so that the services are more evenly distributed across 
all locations.
